Component: Controls Overlay
Purpose:
Make controls discoverable at all times without cluttering mission readability.

Inputs:
- Mode (`title`, `hub`, `mission`, `result`).
- Key toggle `H`.
- Objective state for mission-specific hint text.

Outputs:
- Context-specific controls panel on-canvas.
- Persistent HUD hint (`H: Help`).
- Deterministic UI fields in text state:
  - `ui.helpVisible`
  - `ui.contextActions`
  - `ui.objectiveHint`

State:
- `state.ui.helpVisible`: current manual visibility.
- `state.ui.helpPinned`: user has manually toggled help.
- `state.ui.autoHelpUntilFrame`: first-run visibility window.
- `state.ui.firstMissionHelpShown`: mission onboarding gate.

Behavior:
- Auto-help shows at startup and first mission.
- `H` toggles visibility immediately and pins manual preference.
- Overlay strings are concise and mode-appropriate.

Acceptance Checks:
- `H` changes `ui.helpVisible` immediately in `render_game_to_text()`.
- Overlay appears on first boot and first mission without input.
- No overlap that blocks core objective readability.
