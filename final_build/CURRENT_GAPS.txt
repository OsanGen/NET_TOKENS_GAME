final_build (component | status | next action)
- Mission Flow | done | verify all task variants remain gated by target capture in longer play sessions
- Hub Flow | in_progress | tune HUB_NODE_MIN_GAP and board spacing after one full 10-seed smoke pass
- Controls Overlay | in_progress | run a 390px and 768px snapshot pass validating wrapper-based command shell layout, deep color sweep, action-row hover/selection sheen, and CTA pulse after new shell/overlay tokenized animation layers
- Visual Shell Wrapper | in_progress | run quick DOM smoke to validate new `.command-shell` / `.command-stage` wrappers don’t impact Playwright text capture or selector stability
- Visual Dynamics | in_progress | capture 390px and 768px snapshots for modern+minimal+neon presets and measure transition smoothness of shell shimmer/ornament orbiting
- Local Launch Tooling | done | stale/reused PID handling now guarded; keep using `scripts/open-game.sh` for reliable open/start on `5170`
- Validation Loop | in_progress | run a local smoke pass through key flows (title→hub→mission→result) at normal and reduced-motion settings
- Visual Asset Content | blocked | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` then run `bash scripts/generate-imagegen-assets.sh` to regenerate all 24 sprites from CogSec-compliant prompts and sync 64x64 outputs into `assets/sprites`
- Skill Client Tooling | blocked | align module resolution for `/Users/abelsanchez/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` if strict skill-client execution is required
- Core Runtime | done | node-check passed + Playwright smoke runs and returns frames in output/web-game
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | run desktop/mobile smoke to confirm reduced-motion body class and post-process envelope reads stable after grain/noise removal
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | validate sprite micro-atmosphere pass visually on 320x180 and 640x360 while checking frame jitter stays acceptable after static wash replacement
- Pages Deployment | done | new repo `NET_TOKENS_GAME` is deployed at `https://osangen.github.io/NET_TOKENS_GAME/`; old repo `ai-power-users-codex53-demo` rollback commits are on `main` and no longer serve NET_TOKENS_GAME branding
