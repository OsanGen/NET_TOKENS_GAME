Component: HUD Layering and Information Hierarchy
Purpose:
Maintain readable, non-noisy HUD composition by defining strict layering, priority, and persistence rules for mission, battle, and status text so users can parse the game state immediately.

Scope:
- HUD panel and control card layering order.
- Priority rules for objective, threat, mission context, and controls.
- Text density constraints for compact layouts.
- Visual emphasis and de-emphasis of secondary information.

Inputs:
- Mode (`title`, `hub`, `mission`, `battle`, `result`).
- Mission state:
  - active objectives, threat level, launch/cooldown hints.
- Battle state:
  - turn owner, last action, impact feedback.
- Visual profile and motion mode (modern/minimal/neon/cinematic, reduced-motion).

Outputs:
- Deterministic DOM text precedence:
  - primary objective/status first, then contextual hints, then diagnostics.
- Layer ordering:
  - scene/canvas visual base, HUD panel, action/controls, ephemeral impact overlays.
- Readability guarantees:
  - key action paths and navigation labels stay visible in viewport.

State model:
- No gameplay state changes.
- Existing HUD state fields drive presentation state.
- Optional render-time hierarchy flags:
  - "compactMode", "emphasisLevel", "overflowSuppressed".

Rules:
- Primary layer:
  - mode title, objective, active mission context.
- Secondary layer:
  - threat meter, mission counts, status micro-notices.
- Tertiary layer:
  - optional help hints, debug-like text, noncritical console notes.
- Tertiary layer is suppressed under:
  - mobile width,
  - reduced-motion,
  - high-noise visual mode.
- Any mode transition must re-evaluate and remap hierarchy once; no frame-by-frame reflow drift.

Failure modes addressed:
- Overlapping HUD blocks obscuring primary action targets.
- Action hints stealing visual weight from live game state.
- HUD overflow on compact screens.
- Conflicting priorities between objective and mode prompts.

Error handling:
- Missing DOM fields:
  - show fallback placeholders in primary layer and keep layout stable.
- Overflow risk:
  - gracefully collapse tertiary text and trim repeated tokens.
- Invalid hierarchy input:
  - fallback to default ordering and record warning once.

Acceptance checks:
- Visual smoke at 390x844 and 1366x768 shows primary mission information first and unobscured.
- No key action is hidden behind secondary/tertiary text.
- Mode transitions preserve a deterministic HUD order and no duplicate primary labels.
- On mobile and reduced-motion, tertiary text collapses without affecting core actions.

Non-goals:
- Gameplay logic and mission scripting changes.
- New typography system adoption.
- External UI framework migration.
