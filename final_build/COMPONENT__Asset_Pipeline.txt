Component: Asset Pipeline
Purpose:
Provide deterministic sprite loading with safe fallback rendering and a CogSec-aligned generation path.

Inputs:
- Sprite manifest in `game.js` (`/assets/sprites/*.png`).
- Batch prompt file `tmp/imagegen/astro-gauntlet-assets.jsonl`.
- Generation script `scripts/generate-imagegen-assets.sh`.
- Runtime setting `state.visual.useVectorFallback`.

Outputs:
- `spriteRegistry` entries with `loading|ready|missing` states.
- `spriteStatus` counters (`total`, `loaded`, `missing`) in text payload.
- Procedural brand-safe vector draw path when sprite assets are missing or fallback mode is forced.

State:
- `spriteRegistry` key -> image/status map.
- `spriteStatus` aggregate counts.
- `state.visual.useVectorFallback` currently defaults `true` for strict palette compliance pending regenerated assets.

Pipeline Notes:
- Manifest updated to CogSec prompt locks (token palette only, flat 2D, no glow/no heavy gradients/no 3D).
- Generation script performs batch API render then 64x64 nearest-neighbor downscale sync.

Edge Cases:
- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` aborts generation with explicit error.
- Missing sprite files do not impact gameplay determinism.
- Partial sprite coverage remains playable due per-entity fallback rendering.

Acceptance Checks:
- `render_game_to_text().assets` reflects current loader status.
- Game remains playable with zero sprites available.
- After generation, 24 files are written to `assets/sprites` at 64x64 and can be enabled by disabling vector fallback.
