Component: Brand Scene Engine
Purpose:
Enforce OSAN/CogSec pastel brand constraints consistently across all gameplay scenes.

Inputs:
- Token map (`BRAND_TOKENS`).
- Scene recipe map (`SCENE_RECIPES`).
- Current mode + mission task for accent selection.

Outputs:
- Scene-safe palette application for title/hub/mission/result.
- Single accent lead per scene via `pickAccentLead()`.
- Brand metadata in text state (`ui.brand`, `ui.brandAudit`).

State:
- `state.visual.accentLead`
- `state.visual.contrastMode`
- `state.visual.useVectorFallback`

Rules Enforced:
- White/FOG dominant fields.
- INK for typography and outlines.
- Accent discipline (single lead accent).
- No glow and no heavy gradient effects.

Acceptance Checks:
- Rendered scenes remain legible and token-consistent.
- `ui.brandAudit` reports compliance booleans during runtime.
- Future scene additions can select accent by recipe without color drift.
