Component: Accessibility and Readability Governance
Purpose:
Keep the interface understandable at a glance and operable with predictable keyboard behavior for non-technical users, while preserving the modern visual direction.

This component governs contrast, text hierarchy, focus visibility, and motion safety without changing gameplay rules.

Scope:
- UI text and control readability
- Focus and keyboard access in canvas-adjacent command areas
- Motion safety in reduced-motion contexts
- Visual hierarchy consistency across themes and viewports

Inputs:
- DOM state:
  - `#controls-panel`, `#controls-bottom`, `#controls-actions`, `#controls-objective`
  - `#hud-*` nodes
  - `#start-btn`, `#controls-toggle`
- Render state:
  - `state.mode`
  - `state.visual.vfxPreset`
  - `state.visual.visualProfile`
  - `state.visual.visualProfileAuto`
- Body attributes:
  - `data-game-mode`
  - `data-visual-preset`
  - `data-motion-state`
- User input:
  - keyboard traversal events
  - focus transitions on Tab/Enter/Arrow keys.

Outputs:
- Consistent readable hierarchy:
  - title/hint -> action row -> telemetry/context.
- Predictable focus affordance at command rails.
- Reduced visual fatigue via safer motion cadence.
- Reduced reliance on color-only meaning.

Controls:
- Text sizing and font weight tokens for command and metric content.
- Contrast and stroke tokens for `is-critical`, `is-warning`, `is-ready`, `is-muted`, `is-digital`.
- Focus ring visibility and focus-order rules in CSS.
- Reduced-motion adaptation path for shell and animation layers.

State:
- No gameplay state mutation.
- Ephemeral accessibility state:
  - last focus source (keyboard vs pointer),
  - current focus mode (`panel`, `actions`, `rail`),
  - warnings for invalid/hidden focus targets.

Behavior contract:
- Focus:
  - Tab must always enter an in-page interactive control set.
  - focus rings must remain visible under modern/minimal motion constraints.
- Readability:
  - status/action text remains legible at 390x844.
- Motion:
  - prefers-reduced-motion and `data-motion-state="reduced"` force near-static decorative motion.
- Spatial:
  - no clipping of help/action text in fixed-height bottom rails.

Decision and fallback:
- If focus target disappears:
  - move focus deterministically to nearest parent control container.
- If text contrast fails:
  - move to next safer token profile until deterministic recovery succeeds.
- If ARIA state missing:
  - log a single recoverable warning and continue; do not block gameplay.

Dependencies:

- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/styles.css`
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/game.js`
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/final_build/COMPONENT__Input_Navigation_Focus.txt`
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/final_build/COMPONENT__Controls_Overlay.txt`

Acceptance checks:
- All primary commands are keyboard-reachable in desktop and mobile layouts.
- Bottom actions remain visible and readable without zoom.
- Focus never becomes invisible after any key transition in active modes.
- No key phrase depends only on color for meaning.
- Reduced-motion preference keeps text and contrast stable.
- No critical control text appears below 16px effective size at tested resolutions.

Quality checks:
- Contrast ratio checks for high-importance text against nearby backgrounds in captured modern/minimal modes.
- Focus ring visibility checks in both normal and reduced-motion states.
- Overflow checks on action labels and objective text at 390px width.

Failure modes:
- Keyboard dead-ends due to tabindex/DOM order mismatch.
- Overcrowded action labels obscuring action semantics.
- Motion glare reducing text contrast.

Non-goals:
- Full WCAG audit implementation across all external pages.
- Audio/haptic accessibility additions.
- Gameplay semantics changes.
