This glossary standardizes terminology used across docs, runtime code, and operations.

Game modes
- `title`
  - Startup mode shown at first launch.
- `hub`
  - World-entry and mission launch state.
- `mission`
  - Active objective-driven gameplay loop.
- `battle`
  - Combat-focused mode with turn/action resolution.
- `result`
  - Mission completion or failout transition state.

Runtime state objects
- `mode`
  - Current high-level state of gameplay flow.
- `time`
  - Accumulated runtime time used for animation and sequencing.
- `tick`
  - Per-frame delta counter or progression index.
- `seed`
  - Determinism source for repeatable state outcomes.
- `visual`
  - Nested state bucket for presets, profile, pulses, and motion controls.
- `battle`
  - Nested state bucket for active combat participants, turns, and actions.
- `mission`
  - Mission model with objective identifiers, thresholds, and completion flags.

Rendering and visual terms
- `render`
  - Per-frame composition call for canvas output.
- `post-process`
  - Secondary rendering phase for tone/vignette/noise/impact effects.
- `pulse`
  - Temporary effect driver with intensity, duration, and decay behavior.
- `impact`
  - Visual signal generated by battle actions to indicate hit quality and direction.
- `profile`
  - Motion/presentation configuration family (normal/minimal/etc.).
- `preset`
  - Visual preset family used for tone and style variants.

Input and control terms
- `syncExternalControlsUI`
  - Runtime method that pushes authoritative state into DOM control nodes.
- `H` key
  - Toggle help and/or UI overlay visibility.
- `F` key
  - Fullscreen toggle.
- `V` key
  - Cycle visual preset.
- `P` key
  - Cycle visual profile.
- `action rail`
  - Bottom control region containing current mode actions.
- `side rail`
  - Right-side control/telemetry region.

API surface terms
- `render_game_to_text`
  - Deterministic text snapshot of current public state.
- `advanceTime(ms)`
  - Manual deterministic step function for runtime progression.

Tooling terms
- `Playwright smoke`
  - Automated browser-driven smoke test flow for selector/API/flow validation.
- `Pages artifact`
  - Static deployment bundle pushed by GitHub Pages workflow.
- `local launch`
  - Local `http.server` bootstrap flow via shell tooling.

  - Documented unresolved issue in `CURRENT_GAPS.txt`.
- `gap close`
  - State transition from unresolved to closed with evidence.

Security/reliability terms
- `contract drift`
  - Breakage due to mismatched interface assumptions (selector/API/state fields).
- `reduced-motion-safe`
  - Visual path with lower intensity/animation under reduced motion expectations.
- `artifact omission`
  - Deployment failure mode from missing required static files.
- `idempotent tooling`
  - Repeated local starts/stops that do not produce stale process residue.

Documentation map terms
- `BUILD_MAP`
  - Canonical architecture map.

  - Per-component specs with purpose, inputs/outputs, and checks.
- `CURRENT_GAPS.txt`
  - Living list of unresolved items.
- `LINEAGE_AND_CHANGE_LOG.txt`
  - Time-ordered narrative of meaningful modifications.
- `ARCHIVAL_ROLLUP`
