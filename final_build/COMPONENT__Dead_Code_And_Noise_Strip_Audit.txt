Component: Dead Code and Noise-Strip Audit
Purpose:
Identify and remove non-functional/unused code paths, stale selectors, and obsolete visual chrome that no longer serve gameplay or accessibility.

This component is the cleanup governance layer for the complaint classes:
- "looks the same"
- "too much noise"
- "UI clutter"
- "unused controls shown"

Scope:
- Static/static-like analysis plus deterministic runtime verification.
- No feature additions.
- No gameplay contract changes.

Inputs:
- Source files:
  - `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/index.html`
  - `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/styles.css`
  - `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/game.js`
- Runtime state:
  - active selectors observed in DOM snapshots
  - style rules actually exercised in smoke captures.
- QA fixtures:
  - current deterministic selector coverage baseline
  - key screenshots and viewport states.

Outputs:
- Dead code registry with concrete remediation actions.
- List of hard deletions vs guarded removals.
- Audit matrix of unused nodes/effects and risk level.

Inputs to audit:
- CSS rulesets with no matching DOM node for N consecutive runs.
- JS branches not exercised by deterministic smoke matrix.
- DOM IDs/classes referenced only by stale code.
- "Noise strip" classes and sections not tied to active UX decisions.

Behavior model:
- Static pass:
  - parse for CSS selectors by class/ID.
  - cross-reference with runtime/DOM snapshots and JS references.
- Dynamic pass:
  - run baseline mode flow and record selector coverage.
- Decision matrix:
  - Hard delete if never used and no external contract dependence.
  - Guarded migration if used only by legacy/hidden branch.
  - Keep if external integrator depends on it or if contract uncertain.
- Visual-noise cleanup:
  - remove decorative strips/footers not used for gameplay or controls.
  - keep only one authoritative action strip and one actionable HUD context path.

Error handling:
- If uncertain ownership found:
  - keep path temporarily with TODO + risk note.
- If hard delete would break screenshot path:
  - rollback in branch and classify as "blocked debt" with proof.

Acceptance criteria:
- No stale selector remains in smoke-critical mode flow:
  - every retained ID/class in styles has observed usage or explicit contract reason.
- Confirmed dead code candidates are documented with:
  - location, owner component, impact, and action.
- Hard delete candidates for visual noise are either removed or fenced behind debug flag.
- `#controls-foot`, `.status-strip`, and any duplicated footnote noise strip variants removed from final markup and CSS.
- `current build and QA scripts` remain green after removal.

Risks:
- Over-pruning may remove external integration points unexpectedly.
- False-positive in selector coverage if dynamic generation occurs outside smoke path.
- Styling order issues if dead rule removal changes cascade unexpectedly.

Dependencies:

- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/final_build/COMPONENT__QA_Harness_And_Runbook.txt`

Verification workflow:
1) Take baseline snapshots for title/hub/mission/battle at required viewports.
2) Cross-match CSS and DOM coverage.
3) Produce deletion list with confidence score (high/medium/low).
4) Remove only high-confidence noise/legacy entries.
5) Re-run QA harness smoke and update gap statuses.

Acceptance metrics:
- Number of orphan selectors reduced by at least 50% after one cleanup pass.
- No new S0 selector diff failures.
- Visual noise complaint checklist shows:
  - no duplicate bottom noise bars
  - no stale footer hints
  - no hidden full-screen grain overlays in default modern.

Non-goals:
- Rewriting gameplay state machine.
- Changing mission/combat logic.
- Introducing runtime config servers.

Hard deletion rule:
- For each entry in this audit, provide a "why not use" rationale before removal.
- If rationale is incomplete, default to keep and annotate for later cleanup.
