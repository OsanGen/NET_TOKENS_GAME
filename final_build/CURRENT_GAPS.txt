final_build (component | status | next action)
- Mission Flow | done | verify all task variants remain gated by target capture in longer play sessions
- Combat Loop | in_progress | validate battle menu navigation accepts left/right and up/down for root/fight/switch layers without regression in confirm/cancel flow
- Hub Flow | in_progress | validate clean-hub pass (reduced overlay FX, realistic vector ship glyph, realistic planet node shading, mini-tags only) across multiple seeds for readability and lock clarity
- Controls Overlay | done | hard-deleted noisy `#controls-foot` and `.status-strip` surfaces; split layout remains stage + side rail + bottom action rail
- Visual Shell Wrapper | in_progress | run quick DOM smoke to validate new `.command-shell` / `.command-stage` wrappers don’t impact Playwright text capture or selector stability
- Visual Dynamics | in_progress | validate INTERNAL_RENDER_SCALE reset to 1 and increased sprite/planet scales remove grain while preserving readable gameplay geometry on desktop/mobile
- Local Launch Tooling | done | stale/reused PID handling now guarded; keep using `scripts/open-game.sh` for reliable open/start on `5170`
- Validation Loop | in_progress | run a local smoke pass through key flows (title→hub→mission→result) at normal and reduced-motion settings
- Visual Asset Content | blocked | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` then run imagegen for upgraded `ship.png` and `planet-node.png` (photoreal-styled game sprites), then integrate and compare against current vector fallback
- Asset Pipeline | in_progress | validate sprite loader works without HEAD and works for file:// + subpath deployments
- Visual Asset Content | in_progress | validate enlarged runtime sprite render scale across hub/mission/battle so 64x64 art reads clearly on desktop and mobile
- Visual Asset Content | done | rerun imagegen with provided key and concurrency 1, validated all 24 prompts render and sync to `assets/sprites`; next action: run a visual QA pass on updated 64x64 sprites in hub/mission loops
- Skill Client Tooling | blocked | align module resolution for `/Users/abelsanchez/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` if strict skill-client execution is required
- Core Runtime | done | dead code removed from runtime (`normalizeModeTransition`, `biomeAccentToken`, `drawHubFocusCard`, `drawMissionStatusStrip`) and node/smoke checks rerun without regressions
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | validate battle strike impact VFX in play: low/high damage and player/enemy side directionality, and confirm effect remains readable under reduced-motion/minimal profile without layout clutter
- Pages Deployment | done | new repo `NET_TOKENS_GAME` is deployed at `https://osangen.github.io/NET_TOKENS_GAME/`; old repo `ai-power-users-codex53-demo` rollback commits are on `main` and no longer serve NET_TOKENS_GAME branding
