Pages Deployment

Purpose:
- Provide a deterministic, minimal GitHub Pages public release path for the static game bundle.
- Publish `index.html`, `game.js`, `styles.css`, `favicon.ico`, and `assets/` to a repo-style public URL (example `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`).
- Support migration of the public demo to a new repository and rollback of prior accidental publish changes on a legacy repo.

Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs:
  - Pushes to `main` branch.
  - Manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger.
  - Static files present at repository root: `index.html`, `game.js`, `styles.css`, `favicon.ico`, `assets/`.
  - Target repository name (new repo should remain clean and public; current target is `NET_TOKENS_GAME`).
- Outputs:
  - A published GitHub Pages deployment containing only the static game files in repo `NET_TOKENS_GAME`.
  - Public URL generated by GitHub Pages for the repository: `https://osangen.github.io/NET_TOKENS_GAME/`.
  - `ai-power-users-codex53-demo` remains a legacy repo and is no longer the active Net Tokens hosting target after revert.

Dependencies:
- GitHub Actions runtime (`actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`, `actions/deploy-pages@v4`).
- Repository configured with Pages source `GitHub Actions` for `NET_TOKENS_GAME`.
- GitHub Pages enabled for repo under repository settings.
- Rollback workflow target (`ai-power-users-codex53-demo`) performs safe reverse commits via `git revert` and final push to `main`.

Behavior:
- Workflow checks out source, copies required static files into `publish/`, uploads artifact, then deploys to Pages.
- No build/transpile step is required.
- Workflow is non-destructive and branch-gated to `main`.
- Rollback branch is done by dedicated revert commit chain and does not alter repository history via reset.

State:
- No persistent runtime state in code.
- Deployment outputs are generated artifacts in GitHub Actions execution context.

Stateful/External Effects:
- Remote publish artifact and Pages state managed by GitHub.
- Cache invalidation and rollout follow GitHub Actions/Pages defaults.

Edge Cases:
- Missing `index.html`/`game.js`/`styles.css`/`favicon.ico` will fail artifact creation/deploy in CI and require commit fix.
- Incorrect repo path naming requires users to update any manually shared links to match actual `<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- If `assets/` is absent, deployment may still succeed but runtime references can 404.
- Build source mismatch (accidental workflow source or old Pages config) can route traffic to legacy repo; verify repo and source mode in Settings before sharing link.

Acceptance Checks:
- File `/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` exists and contains a `main`/`workflow_dispatch` trigger.
- New repo deployment contains only intended static files/directories (`index.html`, `game.js`, `styles.css`, `favicon.ico`, `assets/sprites`, plus `.github` workflow source).
- `curl -I https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` and static asset URLs return HTTP 200 for a successful deployment run.
- `window.render_game_to_text` and `window.advanceTime` remain unchanged in gameplay runtime behavior (runtime remains in `game.js`).
- Legacy demo URL does not show `NET_TOKENS_GAME` branding after rollback push (e.g., `curl` probe on `/` or `index.html` source check).
