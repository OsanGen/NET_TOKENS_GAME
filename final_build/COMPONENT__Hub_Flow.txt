Component: Hub Flow
Purpose:
Provide deterministic ship-hub navigation with clear planet selection and launch-lock behavior.

Inputs:
- Player hub movement.
- Seeded planet list from `generateHub(seed)`.
- `Space` edge input near a planet.

Outputs:
- `planetLockId` + `planetLockTimer` update lifecycle.
- Mission start when lock timer completes while player remains in proximity.
- Hub render with route links, readable labels, and launch prompts.

Visual Behavior:
- Route nodes render in a board-like layout with larger mission cards, directional route arrows, and focus halos.
- Mission preview cards include biome and target-specimen chips and deterministic route copy.

State:
- `state.hubs`: four seeded planets around centered hub anchor.
- `state.planetLockId`: current locked planet id or `null`.
- `state.planetLockTimer`: countdown frames before launch.
- `state.visual`: scene-level branding and accent metadata used by post-process render effects.

Layout Rules:
- Deterministic nodes are generated from `seed()` with per-index fan angles and radii.
- Position solver applies a fixed-pass separation pass (`relaxHubPlanets`) to avoid overlap.
- Coordinates are clamped to `HUB_NODE_MARGIN` bounds for label-safe room.
- Route order is computed by angle around center to produce readable looped links.
- Planet cards are rendered near each node with mission-preview fields.

Edge Cases:
- Leaving proximity during lock cancels timer and requires re-lock.
- Hub returns from result reset lock state cleanly.
- Start button is hidden outside title mode to prevent accidental overlay clutter.
- Preview text uses deterministic local seed sampling so node card hints match mission generation.

Acceptance Checks:
- Player can lock and launch every visible planet deterministically.
- No clipped/off-canvas planet labels under normal seed runs.
- Route path is readable and does not self-overlap heavily for default counts.
- Node previews render deterministic mission hints without mutating global RNG.
- Lock messages and countdown match behavior in text state.
