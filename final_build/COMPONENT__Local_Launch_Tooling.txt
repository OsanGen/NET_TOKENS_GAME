Component: Local Launch Tooling
Purpose:
Provide a reliable local open/start flow for the game so browser and Playwright can connect consistently.

Inputs:
- Shell runtime with `bash`, `python3`, `curl`, and `open`.
- Optional env vars:
  - `GAME_PORT` (default `5170`)
  - `GAME_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`)

Outputs:
- Running static server process for workspace root.
- Browser open at the configured URL.
- PID/log artifacts:
  - `/tmp/astro_gauntlet_<port>.pid`
  - `/tmp/astro_gauntlet_<port>.log`

State:
- `scripts/open-game.sh` checks PID file, validates that PID belongs to `python3 -m http.server` on the requested port, verifies active listener, then starts server if needed.
- `scripts/open-game.sh` clears stale/reused PID files before launch decisions.
- `scripts/stop-game.sh` kills tracked PID only when it is the expected http server process, otherwise it clears stale PID state.

Edge Cases:
- Stale PID file with dead process: start script restarts cleanly.
- Stale PID file with reused live process: start script ignores stale PID and starts correct server.
- Missing PID file: stop script exits safely without failure.
- Slow startup: start script retries readiness checks before reporting failure.

Dependencies:
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/scripts/open-game.sh`
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/scripts/stop-game.sh`

Acceptance Checks:
- `scripts/open-game.sh` exits `0` and prints open URL.
- `curl -I http://localhost:5170` returns `200`.
- Playwright probe can `goto` the URL without `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.
