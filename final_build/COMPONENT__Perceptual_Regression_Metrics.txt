Component: Perceptual Regression Metrics
Purpose:
Create a lightweight, repeatable process to prove visual changes are actually noticeable and that the interface has improved beyond tiny style tweaks.

This component focuses on perceptual quality evidence for modern vs previous visuals without changing game behavior.

Inputs:
- Visual state captures:
  - deterministic screenshot frames from title, hub, mission, battle, result modes
  - same mode seeds for fair comparison
  - multiple viewport samples (390x844, 1366x768)
- Runtime metadata:
  - `window.render_game_to_text()`
  - selected profile (`state.visual.vfxPreset`)
  - mode markers (`state.mode`)
- Motion policy:
  - normal vs reduced-motion preferences
  - profile transitions (`V`, `P` toggles).

Outputs:
- A concise report showing whether the latest visuals are materially improved by:
  - clarity
  - readability
  - control density
  - contrast stability
  - artifact reduction.
- Candidate artifacts list for non-compliant scenes.
- Baseline snapshots retained for comparison.

State:
- No gameplay state mutation.
- Report metadata only:
  - screenshot hash list
  - scene mode tags
  - profile label
  - measured metrics and manual review outcomes.

Visual evidence contract:
- Capture points per run:
  - title at boot
  - hub arrival
  - mission launch
  - battle start
  - impact moments
  - result screen end.
- Capture timing:
  - static states and 1–2 high-motion frames.
- Consistency:
  - same input timeline and seeds per mode.

Metrics:
- Structural readability score (manual but standardized):
  - ship/planet subject prominence
  - HUD legibility
  - action button clarity
  - command rail hierarchy.
- Artifact score:
  - noise perception level
  - grain/flicker count
  - contrast wash impact.
- Motion safety score:
  - reduced-motion equivalence of static state.
- Perceived modernization score:
  - does it look materially more “premium” vs previous pass.

Manual rubric (5-point each):
- Readability
- Clarity
- Professional polish
- Control scannability
- Overall visual coherence

Scoring rule:
- Pass if all five metrics are ≥4 for at least two profiles and both critical viewports.
- Fail if any critical metric ≤2 in modern mode.

Failure modes:
- No visible difference from previous theme despite config changes.
- Subject readability lower despite fewer artifacts.
- UI appears cluttered by over-strong shell chrome.
- Modern preset no better than older versions in subjective score.

- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/NEWGAME/final_build/COMPONENT__Brand_Compliance_And_Palette_Governance.txt`

Acceptance checks:
- Perceptual delta documented as visible improvement vs prior checkpoint.
- No false-positive visual quality regression in reduced-motion mode.
- Any non-improved scene gets one explicit follow-up gap with actionable fix.
- At least one screenshot artifact retained per mode for audit continuity.

Verification flow:
1) Run deterministic QA mode flow.
2) Capture screenshots on required viewports.
3) Apply scoring rubric.
4) Record pass/fail per mode/profile.
5) Promote to done only when modernization score and readability score are both improved.

Non-goals:
- Pixel-perfect computer vision similarity scoring.
- Auto-ML judging of art direction.
- Gameplay logic changes or deterministic simulation tuning.
