final_build (component | status | next action)
- Mission Flow | done | verify all task variants remain gated by target capture in longer play sessions
- Hub Flow | in_progress | tune HUB_NODE_MIN_GAP and board spacing after one full 10-seed smoke pass
- Controls Overlay | in_progress | run a visual smoke pass for right-rail desktop and stacked mobile layouts to confirm collapsed/expanded panel readability
- Local Launch Tooling | done | stale/reused PID handling now guarded; keep using `scripts/open-game.sh` for reliable open/start on `5170`
- Validation Loop | done | continue using `web_game_playwright_client_local.js` plus deterministic probe scripts for task-specific checks
- Visual Asset Content | blocked | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` then run `bash scripts/generate-imagegen-assets.sh` to regenerate all 24 sprites from CogSec-compliant prompts and sync 64x64 outputs into `assets/sprites`
- Skill Client Tooling | blocked | align module resolution for `/Users/abelsanchez/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` if strict skill-client execution is required
- Core Runtime | done | node-check passed + Playwright smoke runs and returns frames in output/web-game
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | finalize next visual polish sweep after UI shell upgrade and confirm command dock/input rail stays readable on 390px wide viewports
- Pages Deployment | done | new repo `NET_TOKENS_GAME` is deployed at `https://osangen.github.io/NET_TOKENS_GAME/`; old repo `ai-power-users-codex53-demo` rollback commits are on `main` and no longer serve NET_TOKENS_GAME branding
