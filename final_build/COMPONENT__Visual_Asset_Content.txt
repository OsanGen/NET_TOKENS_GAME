Component: Visual Asset Content
Purpose:
Deliver CogSec-compliant 64x64 sprite assets and keep gameplay readable while generation is pending.

Inputs:
- Prompt manifest: `tmp/imagegen/astro-gauntlet-assets.jsonl` (24 entries).
- Generator: `scripts/generate-imagegen-assets.sh`.
- Imagegen CLI: `/Users/abelsanchez/.codex/skills/imagegen/scripts/image_gen.py`.
- Env requirement: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Outputs:
- Regenerated PNG assets for:
  - 24 sprite manifests from `tmp/imagegen/astro-gauntlet-assets.jsonl`,
  - 16 alien entities (including the eight regenerated ones),
  - astronaut,
  - enemy,
  - beacon,
  - probe,
  - planet node,
  - ship.
- 64x64 nearest-neighbor sprite files in `assets/sprites/`.

Current Status:
- Prompt manifest currently targets CogSec Pastel style locks:
  - token palette only,
  - thin INK outlines,
  - flat 2D,
  - no glow/heavy gradients,
  - no 3D cues.
- Live generation completed using provided `OPENAI_API_KEY` with low parallelism:
  - `IMAGEGEN_CONCURRENCY=1`
  - missing 8 prompts regenerated and synced successfully
  - raw and synced outputs now both at 24 files.

Runtime Fallback Strategy:
- `state.visual.useVectorFallback` forces brand-safe vector rendering until regenerated sprites are available.
- Existing sprite loader remains active and deterministic.

Acceptance Checks:
 - After API key is set and generation is rerun with throttled concurrency, batch generation succeeds and syncs 24 sprite files.
- Runtime can switch from vector fallback to generated sprites without logic changes.
- All generated assets remain readable at 64x64 scale and palette-compliant.
