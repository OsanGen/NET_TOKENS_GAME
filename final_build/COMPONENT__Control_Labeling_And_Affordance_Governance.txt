Component: Control Labeling and Affordance Governance
Purpose:
Standardize control labels, symbols, and interaction semantics so navigation and actions remain intuitive (especially in action-heavy contexts) while keeping gameplay behavior unchanged.

Scope:
- Runtime control text and label generation.
- Directional affordance consistency (left/right for horizontal rails, up/down for nested contexts).
- Prompt/cue grammar and casing for action rows, objective hints, and startup/help text.
- Compact-mode and reduced-motion label density controls.

Inputs:
- Runtime mode and active action context:
  - `title`, `hub`, `mission`, `battle`, `result`.
- Control model:
  - action labels from current mode action list.
- Input conventions and active locale assumptions.

Outputs:
- Consistent control strings:
  - action prompts, navigation hints, and confirm/cancel labels.
- Consistent affordance cues:
  - clear distinction between rail navigation, nested navigation, and commit actions.
- Compact-label behavior:
  - secondary hints trimmed before overflow thresholds are reached.

State model:
- No additional gameplay state.
- Existing label/command state remains source of truth.
- Optional render-time label policy (compact/standard/tight) derived from viewport and profile.

Primary policy:
- Horizontal navigation keys (`left/right` or mapped equivalents) control peer-level action rails.
- Vertical navigation keys (`up/down`) control nested contexts or modal step depth only.
- `Tab` and `Enter/Space` maintain focus traversal and explicit activation semantics.
- Confirm/cancel text is explicit and avoids directional ambiguity.
- Help/runtime hints are contextual and never replace primary objective/action labels.

Failure modes addressed:
- Directional mismatch causing confusing traversal.
- Overlong/misaligned labels obscuring core objective controls.
- Hint overload in compact viewport.
- Modal action text changing unexpectedly between presets.

Edge cases:
- Very small viewport with reduced label width:
  - truncate with ellipsis and preserve action verb/noun.
- Dynamic action list changes between frames:
  - update labels atomically to avoid mismatch with action indices.
- Mixed input modalities:
  - keyboard-only and quick-restart contexts keep same label semantics.

Error handling:
- Missing label content:
  - fallback to canonical stable placeholder.
- Unsupported control tokens:
  - skip and keep previous known-safe label.
- Label overflow:
  - deterministic truncation with consistent suffix behavior.

Acceptance checks:
- UI smoke on 390x844 and 1366x768 verifies label text remains readable and no clipping in action rail.
- Held-left/right traversal maps to expected horizontal rail changes in mixed flat menus.
- Up/down traversal only changes nested context when applicable.
- No duplicate action index jumps when confirm/cancel labels are rendered during held key sessions.

Non-goals:
- Full localization/locales pipeline.
- Game mechanic or action model refactor.
- Adding accessibility announcement engine outside existing hints pipeline.
