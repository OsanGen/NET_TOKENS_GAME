Component: Mission Flow
Purpose:
Guarantee mission completion only when both requirements are true:
1) required target species capture
2) task-specific objective completion

Inputs:
- Mission seed and task template from `makeMission`.
- `input.space` for mission interactions.
- Player/entity positions and per-frame deterministic updates.

Outputs:
- Objective progress updates:
  - `targetCaptured`, `targetRequired`, `taskDone`, `done`.
- Success transition through unified gate:
  - `if (targetDone && taskDone) endMission(true)`.

State:
- `state.mission.task.id`: `collect | clear_wave | hold_sector | activate_beacon | escort_probe`.
- `state.mission.extractionZone` for escort tasks.
- `state.objective.current` fields for task and capture progress.

Task Rules:
- `collect`: target captured count meets target required.
- `clear_wave`: enemy count reaches zero after neutralization plus target capture.
- `hold_sector`: hold progress reaches target value plus target capture.
- `activate_beacon`: beacon activated with `Space` in range plus target capture.
- `escort_probe`: probe attached and player overlaps extraction zone plus target capture.

Edge Cases:
- No direct mission success shortcuts in probe entity update.
- Beacon activation no longer bypasses unified completion gate.
- Enemy neutralization uses live `input.space` and cooldown.

Acceptance Checks:
- Escort missions are reachable under player movement clamps.
- Beacon missions can complete when in-range `Space` is used.
- Clear-wave missions support practical enemy elimination with ion burst.
- Objective payload remains consistent for Playwright assertions.
