External Dependencies Matrix — NEWGAME

External dependency type | Dependency | Usage | Why it exists | Failure mode | Mitigation

Runtime dependencies
- None (runtime) | `game.js` has no external JS package imports | keeps the game fully static | None from package manager | self-contained runtime in browser

Development dependencies
- Playwright | `package.json` (`playwright: ^1.58.2`) | Browser automation in `web_game_playwright_client_local.js` | Local smoke/validation requires available package + browser binaries | Keep as dev dependency; avoid runtime coupling

Environment tooling
- bash | `scripts/open-game.sh`, `scripts/stop-game.sh` | local server launch/cleanup orchestration | shell mismatch or permission path issues | keep script logic simple and cross-shell compatible
- python3 | local serve command and optional utility scripts | quick static local host | unavailable Python in environment | use Node server alternative if Python unavailable
- lsof | process conflict detection in local tooling | avoid duplicate server instances | utility missing | degrade to documented manual port checks

CI/platform dependencies
- GitHub Actions runners | `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` | deployment automation | runner outage or permission issues | rerun deployment / use local static hosting for validation
- GitHub Pages service | deployment target host | public demo publication | publish delay / outage | validate from latest successful run logs before release notification

Asset dependencies
- `assets/` path structure | renderer loads sprite URLs | required for visual fidelity and gameplay readability | missing/renamed asset causes visual artifacts | maintain naming map and verify post asset changes

Third-party/AI generation dependencies (optional)
- image generation workflow scripts and provider tooling | `scripts/generate-imagegen-assets.sh`, `tmp/imagegen/` | optional art refresh | provider access/key availability | keep generated assets committed as primary runtime source; avoid runtime generation dependency

Risk grading
- High
  - GitHub Pages artifact omissions
  - stale local tooling PID / port lock
- Medium
  - Playwright version drift in automated capture
  - python3/lsof missing in local dev machines
- Low
  - devDependency not used during production runtime

Dependency hygiene rules
- Do not introduce backend dependencies without a separate deployment architecture.
- Do not add runtime package imports unless a package-level split strategy is documented.
- Keep asset tooling optional for runtime portability.
