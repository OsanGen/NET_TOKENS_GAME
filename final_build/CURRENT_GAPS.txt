final_build (component | status | next action)
- Mission Flow | done | verify all task variants remain gated by target capture in longer play sessions
- Combat Loop | in_progress | validate battle menu navigation accepts left/right and up/down for root/fight/switch layers without regression in confirm/cancel flow
- Hub Flow | in_progress | validate clean-hub pass (reduced overlay FX, realistic vector ship glyph, realistic planet node shading, mini-tags only) across multiple seeds for readability and lock clarity
- Controls Overlay | in_progress | validate compact OSAN-compliant split controls layout (reduced density, lower noise, no page spill) on desktop and 390px/768px with stable `H` toggle behavior
- Visual Shell Wrapper | in_progress | run quick DOM smoke to validate new `.command-shell` / `.command-stage` wrappers don’t impact Playwright text capture or selector stability
- Visual Dynamics | in_progress | confirm reduced modern hub FX (no chromatic bleed/static wash/atmosphere bands) still feels premium without grain artifacts
- Local Launch Tooling | done | stale/reused PID handling now guarded; keep using `scripts/open-game.sh` for reliable open/start on `5170`
- Validation Loop | in_progress | run a local smoke pass through key flows (title→hub→mission→result) at normal and reduced-motion settings
- Visual Asset Content | blocked | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` then run imagegen for upgraded `ship.png` and `planet-node.png` (photoreal-styled game sprites), then integrate and compare against current vector fallback
- Asset Pipeline | in_progress | validate sprite loader works without HEAD and works for file:// + subpath deployments
- Visual Asset Content | in_progress | validate enlarged runtime sprite render scale across hub/mission/battle so 64x64 art reads clearly on desktop and mobile
- Visual Asset Content | done | rerun imagegen with provided key and concurrency 1, validated all 24 prompts render and sync to `assets/sprites`; next action: run a visual QA pass on updated 64x64 sprites in hub/mission loops
- Skill Client Tooling | blocked | align module resolution for `/Users/abelsanchez/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` if strict skill-client execution is required
- Core Runtime | done | node-check passed + Playwright smoke runs and returns frames in output/web-game
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | verify desktop/mobile smoke on deployed build shows visibly distinct modern shell (minimal UI grain, no CRT shimmer, no heavy glow) after default preset load and preset cycling
- Visual Post Process | in_progress | verify title+hub+mission+battle all show readable 10-second captures with lower clutter and stronger white/Fog composition under reduced-motion and normal modes
- Pages Deployment | done | new repo `NET_TOKENS_GAME` is deployed at `https://osangen.github.io/NET_TOKENS_GAME/`; old repo `ai-power-users-codex53-demo` rollback commits are on `main` and no longer serve NET_TOKENS_GAME branding
