Component: Combat Loop
Purpose:
Deliver deterministic enemy pressure with responsive player attack/interact behavior.

Inputs:
- Mission enemy template queue (`enemyQueue`, spawn cadence/timer).
- Player input state (`input.space`, movement keys).
- Active mission entities.

Outputs:
- Deterministic enemy spawn cadence from queued definitions.
- Contact damage + invulnerability + knockback updates.
- Ion burst enemy damage when `Space` is held in range.
- Objective enemy count decrements on enemy neutralization.

State:
- Player combat flags: `hp`, `invulnFrames`, `shootCd`, `damageStreak`, `damageDecay`, `knockbackX/Y`.
- Mission spawn flags: `enemyQueue`, `enemySpawnTimer`, `enemySpawnCadence`.
- `combatConfig` tuning constants for pacing.

Behavior:
- Enemy spawn is deterministic and mission-seed-driven.
- Enemy movement blends inertia + chase vector.
- Player attack checks now rely on `input.space` (not stale player-state field).
- Enemy removal updates score and objective enemy count.

Edge Cases:
- Empty queue means no spawn attempt.
- Invulnerability blocks immediate repeated contact hits.
- Cooldown (`shootCd`) prevents burst spam and keeps pacing readable.

Acceptance Checks:
- Holding `Space` near enemy reduces enemy HP and can remove enemies.
- `clear_wave` missions can progress naturally as enemies are eliminated.
- Same seed + same inputs preserve spawn timing and combat outcomes.
